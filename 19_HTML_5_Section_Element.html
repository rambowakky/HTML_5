        	<h3>Article 1</h3>
        	<p>THE STORY OF CHRISTMAS
		Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows:
 		After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to 
 		make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.
 		</p>
 		<h3>Article 2</h3>
		<p>But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel 
		of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that 
		which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will
 		save His people from their sins.”
